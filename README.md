1. [Curve Fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares#:~:text=The%20method%20of%20least%20squares,an%20observed%20value%20and%20the): Curve fitting is a process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. Here we have used Least Square Method to fit a curve to a given data set.

2. [Regula Falsi Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regula_falsi): The regula falsi method is a root-finding algorithm which combines features from the bisection method and the secant method. The method is also known as the false position method. Here we have used Regula Falsi Method to find the root of a given equation.
